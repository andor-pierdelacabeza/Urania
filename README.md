Urania
======

Star photography and tracking system

Urania pretends to be  (in a near future) a complement for your star gazing/photographing activities.

Right now is based in a Raspberry Pi plus the Raspicam module, but the idea is moving to any debian compatible platform and support other external sensors more suited to astrophotography.

I hope it can:

- [x] Do a live view for focusing
- [ ] Time lapse photos
- [ ] Black frames
- [ ] Alignment
- [ ] Stacking
- [ ] Telescope GoTo
- [ ] GPS time sync and photo tagging
